## How Can I Get Involved?

**FIX ME**

 List ways that people from outside your group can get involved and potentially
 become members, include what meetings your team has, and how a person could
 start participating and contributing. Make sure to mention the main platform
 your group hosts its discussions. Be sure to also include links to any
 other projects that your group maintains.
